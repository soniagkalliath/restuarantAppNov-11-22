                                    - Basic Commands

                        1. to create project - ng new project-name

                        2. to run project - ng serve / ng serve --open

                        3. to generate Components - ng g c component-name

                        4. to create service - ng g s service-name

                        5. to create pipe - ng g p pipe-name



                                    - Basic Concepts

            1. Module - Import libraries  - Root MOdule - AppModule

            2. Components - generate html,css,ts - Root Components - AppComponent

            3. To setup path for Component - AppRoutingModule 
                - syntax: { path:'path name' , component:Component-name } inside Routes Array

            4. Selectors -  replace it with corresponding component html page

            5. router-outlet selector is used to switch
                 page according to user request in Root component html page
             
            6. Angular Service - reusable code can be stored ,
                 and we can use it in all component across the application

            7. Dependency Injection - Share data between dependent classes, (in constructor)
                syntax: access-specifiers variable-name :dependent-class-name
                access-specifiers (public / private)

            8. Asynchronous Function call - (rxjs libraries) Oberservable 
                - resolve (subscribe)
                - reject (catch)

            9. Data Binding - share data within a component

                9.1 One way Binding - share only in one direction at a time

                    9.1.1 component(ts) to view(html) file

                            9.1.1.1 String Interpolation -syntax: {{class-property-name}} in html

                            9.1.1.2 property Binding - syntax: [attribute]="class-property-name"


                    9.1.2 view(html) to component(ts) file

                            9.1.2.1 Event Binding - (event-name)="function call()"

                            9.1.2.2 Event Binding using $event - (event-name)="function call($event)"

                9.2 Two way Binding - share only in two direction at a time

                    9.2.1 ngModel - Import FormsModule , [(ngModel)]="property-name"

            10. Angular Directive - to manipulate DOM 

                10.1 Component Directive 
                10.2 Structural Directive - based on condition or array length we add/remove html 
                                            elements in DOM
                        10.2.1 *ngIf = "condition" inside an html element
                        10.2.3 *ngFor="let iterator of array-name"

                10.3 Attribute Directive - based on some value / class property we can set style
                                            of html elements

            11. Activated Route  - Provides access to information about a route associated with a
                                    component that is loaded in an outlet

            12. ngForm - to track the form values

            13. Pipe - Use pipes to transform strings,
                         currency amounts, dates, and other data for display.

            14. BehaviorSubject - used which acts as a single store to hold updated shared data
